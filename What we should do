Things need to be done before next class:
1. Finish the Codecademey course on numpy and scipy
2. Read through the slides of CH.2
3. Read through several examples of production externality
4. Make sure that ur python can use functinos from numpy and scipy


3/20
1.Simplified CES utility function to just two attributes: goods and factors(checked)
2.Simplified CES production function to just one attribute : factors(checked)
3.Construct social welfare function(checked)
4.Figure out how to maximize the social welfare function with only one person in the economy
5.After finish 4., continue to think how to maximize social welfare when there are more than two kinds of people.

2.Construct optimisation function.
3.Codes right at the beginning to check whether inputs are of the correct data type and range (if-else statements).
4.Update wiki.
